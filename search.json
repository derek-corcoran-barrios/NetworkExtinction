Primary removals: occurs researcher intentionally removes one species, simulating single extinction. Secondary extinctions: secondary extinction occurs non basal species loses prey items due removal another species. context, basal species can experience primary removal, secondary extinctions (Dunne, Williams, Martinez 2002). Total extinctions: sum primary removal secondary extinctions one simulation. package built total six functions. four functions analyze cascading effect extinctions food web, one function plot results extinction analysis, another analyse degree distribution network.
