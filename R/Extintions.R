#' Extinctions analysis for ecological networks
#'
#' The SimulateExtinctions function, can be used to test how the order of species
#' extinctions, species-dependency on existing interaction strength, and rewiring potential might affect the stability of the network by comparing  The extinction history
#' and checking for secondary extinctions.
#'
#' @param Network a network representation as a an adjacency matrix, edgelist,
#' or a network object
#' @param Method a character with the options Mostconnected, Leastconnected and Ordered
#' @param Order a numeric vector indexing order of primary extinctions. For Method = Mostconnected or Leastconnected Order must be NULL. If Order is not NULL, Method is internally forced to be Ordered.
#' @param NetworkType a character with the options Trophic and Mutualistic - is used to calculate secondary extinctions.
#' @param clust.method a character with the options cluster_edge_betweenness,
#' cluster_label_prop or cluster_infomap, defaults to cluster_infomap
#' @param IS either numeric or a named vector of numerics. Identifies the threshold of relative interaction strength which species require to not be considered secondarily extinct (i.e. IS = 0.3 leads to removal of all nodes which lose 70 percent of their interaction strength in the Network argument). If a named vector, names must correspond to vertex names in Network argument.
#' @param Rewiring either a function or a named vector of functions. Signifies how rewiring probabilities are calculated from the RewiringDist argument. If FALSE, no rewiring is carried out.
#' @param RewiringDist a numeric matrix of NxN dimension (N... number of nodes in Network). Contains, for example, phylogenetic or functional trait distances between nodes in Network which are used by the Rewiring argument to calculate rewiring probabilities. If Rewiring == function(x){x}, this matrix is expected to contain probabilities of a connection being present between species-pairs.
#' @param RewiringProb a numeric which identifies the threshold at which to assume rewiring potential is met.
#' @param verbose Logical. Whether to report on function progress or not.
#' @param forceFULL Logical. Whether to continue removal of nodes after initial order has been depleted. This will force the simulations to execute extinctions and check for secondary extinctions/new links until the network does not change anylonger.
#' @return exports list containing a data frame with the characteristics of the network after every extinction and a network object containing the final network. The resulting data frame contains 11 columns that incorporate the topological index, the secondary extinctions, predation release, and total extinctions of the network in each primary extinction.
#' @details When method is Mostconnected, the function takes the network and calculates which node is the most connected of the network, using total degree. Then remove the most connected node, and calculates the the topological indexes of the network and the number of secondary extinctions. This process is repeated until the entire network has gone extinct. When method is Leastconnected, this process prioritises nodes of lowest degree.
#'
#' When method is Ordered, it takes a network, and extinguishes nodes using a custom order, then it calculates the secondary extinctions and plots the accumulated secondary extinctions.
#'
#' When NetworkType = Trophic, secondary extinctions only occur for any predator, but not producers. If NetworkType = Mutualistic, secondary extinctions occur for all species in the network.
#'
#' When clust.method = cluster_edge_betweenness computes the network modularity using cluster_edge_betweenness methods from igraph to detect communities
#' When clust.method = cluster_label_prop computes the network modularity using cluster_label_prop methods from igraph to detect communities
#' When clust.method = cluster_infomap computes the network modularity using cluster_infomap methods from igraph to detect communities, here the number of nb.trials are equal to the network size

#' Extinctions analysis from custom order
#'
#' This function takes a network and eliminates nodes using a custom order. Subsequently, secondary extinctions are tallied up. Secondary extinction severity can be targeted by manipulating the node-dependency on network edges (IS) and node-rewiring potential upon loss of links (Rewiring).

#' @param Order a numeric vector indexing order of primary extinctions. For Method = Mostconnected Order must be NULL. If Order is not NULL, Method is internally forced to be Ordered.

#' Random extinction
#'
#' Generates a null model by generating random extinction histories and calculating the mean and standard deviation of the accumulated secondary extinctions developed by making n random extinction histories.
#'
#' @param Network a network representation as a an adjacency matrix, edgelist,
#' or a network object
#' @param nsim numeric, number of simulations
#' @param Record logical, if TRUE, records every simulation and you can read the
#' raw results in the object FullSims
#' @param plot logical if TRUE, will add a graph to the results
#' @param SimNum numeric, how many nodes to register for primary extinction. By default sets all of them.
#' @param NetworkType a character with the options Trophic and Mutualistic - is used to calculate secondary extinctions.
#' @param clust.method a character with the options cluster_edge_betweenness,
#' cluster_label_prop or cluster_infomap, defaults to cluster_infomap
#' @param parallel if TRUE, it will use parallel procesing, if FALSE (default) it will run
#' sequentially
#' @param ncores numeric, number of cores to use if using parallel procesing
#' @param IS either numeric or a named vector of numerics. Identifies the threshold of relative interaction strength which species require to not be considered secondarily extinct (i.e. IS = 0.3 leads to removal of all nodes which lose 70 precent of their interaction strength in the Network argument). If a named vector, names must correspond to vertex names in Network argument.
#' @param Rewiring either a function or a named vector of functions. Signifies how rewiring probabilities are calculated from the RewiringDist argument. If FALSE, no rewiring is carried out.
#' @param RewiringDist a numeric matrix of NxN dimension (N... number of nodes in Network). Contains, for example, phylogenetic or functional trait distances between nodes in Network which are used by the Rewiring argument to calculate rewiring probabilities. If Rewiring == function(x){x}, this matrix is expected to contain probabilities of a connection being present between species-pairs.
#' @param RewiringProb a numeric which identifies the threshold at which to assume rewiring potential is met.
#' @param verbose Logical. Whether to report on function progress or not.
#' @param forceFULL Logical. Whether to continue removal of nodes after initial order has been depleted. This will force the simulations to execute extinctions and check for secondary extinctions/new links until the network does not change anylonger.
#' @return exports list containing a data frame with the characteristics of the network after every extinction, a network object containing the final network, and a graph with the mean and 95percent interval. The resulting data frame contains 11 columns that incorporate the topological index, the secondary extinctions, predation release, and total extinctions of the network in each primary extinction.
#' @details
#'
#' "Note: When using the pre-defined order of nodes for primary
#' removals option in the random extinction scenario, it is possible
#' that some of the species in the predefined order may be lost as
#' secondary extinctions. As such, they should not be counted as
#' primary removals. For example, if a network has five species {A,B,
#' ,D,E} and a pre-defined "random" order of removal {C,A,B,E,D} with
#' removal of C causing the additional loss of A and removal of B
#' causing the additional loss of E and D, only two primary removals
#' (C and B) would be required for total network collapse, even though
#' the algorithm would terminate at the third element of the removal
#' vector, i.e., {C,A,B}."
#'
#' When NetworkType = Trophic, secondary extinctions only occur for any predator, but not producers. If NetworkType = Mutualistic, secondary extinctions occur for all species in the network.
#'
#' When clust.method = cluster_edge_betweenness computes the network modularity using cluster_edge_betweenness methods from igraph to detect communities
#' When clust.method = cluster_label_prop computes the network modularity using cluster_label_prop methods from igraph to detect communities
#' When clust.method = cluster_infomap computes the network modularity using cluster_infomap methods from igraph to detect communities, here the number of nb.trials are equal to the network size
